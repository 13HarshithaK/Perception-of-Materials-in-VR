# Perception of Materials in VR
Masters thesis experiment and follow-up experiment

This project will soon be uploaded at the CVR github as well: https://github.com/Centre-for-Vision-Research

The materials folder had a sub-folder removed that contained the primary visual stimuli/visual textures. The files were larger than 100 MB and have been moved temporarily to this drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jvo88thZyc8rO8AUMic8yiM3_xA5TxoB?usp=drive_link

A more permanent location will be deicided and this link will be updated accordingly.

The published abstract of this study can be found here: doi:https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.24.10.1208

The thesis (covering experiment 1) can be found here: https://ocul-yor.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_YOR/1jocqcq/alma991037283476005164

The entire study (experiment 1 and 2) is in the process of being published, the DOI will be shared once it is assigned.

No human-subject or personally identifiable data is included. The anonymized user data collected will be uploaded to the university dataverse, the link will be added here once that is completed.

During development, I explored multiple approaches to rendering glass and ultimately designed a custom shader tailored to the needs of this project. The intermediate experiments and the final shader implementation used in the study will be made available in a separate repository soon. This project has both the final glass shader and a few alternatives.
