# Perception of Materials in VR
Masters thesis experiment and follow-up experiment

This project will soon be uploaded at the CVR github as well: https://github.com/Centre-for-Vision-Research

The materials folder had a sub-folder removed that contained the primary visual stimuli/visual textures. The files were larger than 100 MB and have been moved temporarily to this drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jvo88thZyc8rO8AUMic8yiM3_xA5TxoB?usp=drive_link

A more permanent location will be deicided and this link will be updated accordingly.
